/** main.cpp

   This file is part of the handout for the TDT4102 spring 2020 exam.

   Except for changes required to test Assignment S1, S2 and
   optionally F2, you do not need to change or understand this file in
   order solve the assignment.

   This file contains the main function which launches the simulator
   Its only purpose is to parse the command line parameters passed to
   the program and invoke the simulation.
