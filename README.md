# Procedure- and Objectoriented Programming

Programming course at NTNU introducing students to C++ with procedure- and objectoriented programming.

## Academic Content

Basic and practice-oriented programming with the programming language C++. The course covers the essentials of the programming language as well as selected parts of the standard library. Through exercises, students gain extensive experience in software construction, debugging, and testing.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, the candidate can explain key concepts and mechanisms in the programming language C++.

Knowledge: 
* variable declarations and data types
* input/output data handling
* type conversion
* control structures
* functions and operators
* overloading
* classes and inheritance
* templates
* exception handling.
* static/dynamic variables and pointers
* recursion
* algorithms and data structures.
* organize procedural and object-oriented code using modules, source code files, the standard library (STL), compilation, and linking.
* apply common programming techniques and work iteratively and efficiently in code development.
* program input validation and suitable handling of various types of runtime errors.

Skills: By the end of the course, the candidate can 
* use modern development tools
* debugging techniques
* basic testing
* write object-oriented code organized into classes
* construct simple graphical user interfaces
* write reusable, readable, and easy-to-maintain code
* read code and explain how the code behaves at runtime.

General Competence: By the end of the course, the candidate can 
* communicate and discuss code solutions and explain how a program works
* find and utilize tools and documentation for the programming language and standard library
* recognize aspects of programming that may affect information security.
